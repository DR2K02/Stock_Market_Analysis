# Stock_Market_Analysis
This a project of Stock Market Analysis And Forecasting Using Deep Learning(pytorch,gru).

A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic trading platforms.

**Forecasting**

Time series forecasting uses information regarding historical values and associated patterns to predict future activity. Most often, this relates to trend analysis, cyclical fluctuation analysis, and issues of seasonality. As with all forecasting methods, success is not guaranteed.

**GRU Model:**

Gated recurrent unit is essentially a simplified LSTM. It has the exact same role in the network. The main difference is in the number of gates and weights â€” GRU is somewhat simpler. It has 2 gates. Since it does not have an output gate, there is no control over the memory content. The update gate controls the information flow from the previous activation, and the addition of new information as well, while the reset gate is inserted into the candidate activation.
